# Information
Its a app to store information about newly met people. It can be used by multiple users in a same device.
This android app can be used to store few basic information of people you meet. 
You will have to enter the information you gained from the person using "Add Information" tab and save the information using the "save" button. 
You can access the saved information whenever you want to retrieve the information. 
This app uses mobile's internal memory to create text files and store all the information over there. 
The app supports multi user account and the data you stored remains very secured with each user's data being stored under a specific username and password. 
Primarily I have given 5 categories of information to store but I will increase the categories so that a vivid description of the person can be stored. 
A single user can store as many as person's information he wants. Again there can be multiple number of user accounts. 
In future, I would add a few more interesting options in the application such as: Search the information of a person with the name or phone number or any other entity. 
I would add a option to take the image of the person and store it alongside with the information. So that when the user views the information, the picture reminds him of how the person looks like. 
Till now it was restricted to a phone's internal memory but soon the app can use the cloud storage to store information of the file so that user's across the globe can access their stored information from anywhere they want. 
I will add an option to select the type of account the user wants. For example, if a teacher wants to store the information of his newly admitted students, then there will be a teacher-student type of account. 
If a student wants to store information about his new classmates, there will be a student-student account. If a person wants to store information of the labors and maids working in his house, there will be a homely account. 
For a traveler there will be a traveler account to store information of the places he had visited.
Memory is a strange business in human mind. This app will hold each bit of information that you want to store. 
Our brains many a times mixes information of one person with the other. 
This app will help to bind the information of one person with itself and prevent mixing of data that often happens with our brains.
